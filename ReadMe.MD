# Local Reminder app

Small app to have reminders. Created in **python** using the **tkinter** and **customtkinter** libraries.

Create, modify and edit reminders inside you local PC. This is a beginner project so features may be limited.
I created this app so I could have reminders of when certain TV series and anime episodes were uploaded so I
didn't forget to watch them.

- Process for modyfying and deleting reminders
- Ability to select dates
- Ability to insert webpages (example of where to watch a series)
